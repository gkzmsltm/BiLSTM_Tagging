When a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct , it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule .

Opponents show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts . 	NNS VBP IN EX VBP RB JJR NNS JJ IN JJ NN NNS .
