Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .

Two things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of order . 	CD NNS TO VB IN NN : RB DT NNS VBP DT NN IN NN . 
And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer . 	CC RB WRB DT JJ NN VBZ JJ TO DT NN , DT NN NN MD VB TO VB PRP IN DT NN . 
Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions . 	NNP NNP : DT VBZ RB DT RBS RB VBN NN : CC DT CD RBS JJ TO VB IN JJ NN NNS , IN PRP VBZ DT NN NNS . 
With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . '' 	IN DT NN NN , DT NN VBZ DT NN TO VB CC VB `` IN DT NN . '' 
It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . '' 	PRP VBZ IN VBG , `` VB PRP IN RB '' CC `` VB PRP IN RB . ''

Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers . 	NNS VBD IN DT NNS MD RB VB VBN IN DT VBG NNS . 
Limit Order : Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment . 	VB NNP : VB NNS VBP VBN WRB NNS VBP TO VB DT NN PRP MD VB CC VB IN DT NN . 
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it . 	NNS VBP DT IN VBG DT JJ NN IN WDT DT NN MD VB VBN CC DT JJ NN WDT MD VB VBN IN PRP . 
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 . 	VB DT NN VBZ TO VB DT NN , CC RB IN JJR IN $ NN . 
A limit order to sell could be entered at that price . 	DT NN NN TO VB MD VB VBN IN DT NN . 
One risk : Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls . 	CD NN : NNS MD VB DT NN IN DT NN VBZ CD CC RB VBZ . 
Unless the market goes at least one tick -LRB- the smallest price increment permitted -RRB- beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price . 	IN DT NN VBZ IN JJS CD VB ( DT JJS NN NN VBN ) IN DT NN NN , NNS VBP RB VBN IN VBG PRP$ NNS VBN IN EX MD RB VB JJ NN NN TO VB VBG PRP IN DT VBN NN . 
Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level . 	VB NNP : VB NNS VB DT NN NN TO VB CC VB DT NN RB DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN . 
Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get . 	RB DT NN VBZ DT NN , DT NN NN VBZ IN DT NN NN , CC DT NN VBZ VBN IN WDT VBP DT NN MD VB . 
Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses . 	VB NNS VBP RB VBN `` NN '' NNS IN PRP VBP RB VBN TO VB NNS CC NN NNS . 
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above . 	IN NN NNS VBP JJ TO VB NNS , EX VBZ DT NN : VB VBZ MD VB VBN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN CC VB VBZ RB . 
In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below . 	IN NN , VB NN NNS MD VB VBN IN DT NN NN CC VB NN NNS VBP VBN RB .

An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday .

Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order . 	NNP NNP : JJ NNS VBP IN NN NNS WRB DT NN NNS IN DT NN VBN IN DT NN . 
Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price . 	IN NN NNS : WDT VBP VBN IN DT NN NN WRB DT NN NN VBZ VBN : JJ NNS VBP IN DT NNS VBP VBN RB IN DT VBN NN . 
If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled . 	IN PRP MD RB VB VBN IN DT NN , PRP VBZ RB VB VBN . 
Investors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled . 	NNS WP VBP TO VB IN IN DT NN , IN DT NN IN VBG DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN , MD VB DT NN IN NN TO VB DT NN IN WDT DT NN MD VB VBN . 
But if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price . 	CC IN DT NN NNS RB RB , PRP MD VB JJ IN DT NN TO VB RP IN NN IN DT NN VBZ VBN DT VBN NN . 
Market-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached . 	NNP NNP : JJ NNS VBP IN NN NNS IN DT PRP VBP NN NNS IN DT VBN NN VBZ VBN . 
However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it . 	RB , IN DT JJ NN , DT NN NN NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN , IN DT NN NN NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN PRP . 
As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price . 	RB RB IN DT NN NNS IN DT VBN NN DT NN NN MD VB PRP IN DT JJS JJ NN . 
Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades . 	NNP NNP : DT JJ NN VBZ CD IN RB VBN IN DT NN IN NNS . 
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better . 	PRP VBZ DT NN TO VB CC VB DT NN IN DT VBN NN CC JJR . 
But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled . 	CC IN DT NN MD RB VB VBN CC VBN RB , DT NN VBZ RB VBN . 
Gregory Bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options . 	NNP NNP , WP VBD IN JJ IN DT NN NN IN DT RB VBN NNP NNP NNP , VBZ PRP VBZ JJ NNS RB RB WRB NN NNS .

Not-Held Order : This is another timing order . 	NNP NNP : DT VBZ DT NN NN .

One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order . 	NNP NNP : DT VBZ RB CD NNS IN CD , RB IN DT JJ NN CC NN , VBG NN NNS TO VB WDT VBP PRP MD RB CC RB VB DT JJ NN . 
In a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security . 	IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBZ DT NN IN VBG VBN IN VBG VBN CD NNS IN DT JJ NN . 
Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time . 	NNP NNP : DT NN IN NN NNS NN IN DT NNS VBN IN IN NNS IN DT NN MD VB VBN IN IN CC IN DT JJ NN . 
`` On the close '' can be added to many types of orders . 	`` IN DT NN '' MD VB VBN TO VB NNS IN NNS . 
For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange .

`` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . 	`` JJ NNS '' VBP VB NNS WDT RB VB JJ IN DT VBG NNS IN NN . 
`` Day orders '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date . 	`` NNP NNS '' VB IN DT NN IN DT NN IN WDT PRP VBP VBN , `` JJ NNS '' VBP DT NN NN . 
Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . 	JJS NNS VBP IN DT NNS VBP NN NNS IN VBN RB .

IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments , there 's probably no starting place better than `` beta . '' 	IN NNP IN DT NNS IN NN NNS , EX VBZ RB DT VBG NN JJR IN `` NN . '' 
But investors better not ignore its limitations , either . 	CC NNS RBR RB VB PRP$ NNS , RB . 
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund . 	NNP VBZ DT JJ NN IN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN CC NN JJ NN . 
For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall . 	IN DT VBN NN IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBZ WRB RB IN JJ NN MD VB CC NN . 
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret . 	JJ NNS VBP RB JJ CC JJ TO VB . 
The beta of the broad market , typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , is always 1.0 . 	DT NN IN DT JJ NN , RB VBN IN DT NNP CC NNP POS JJ NN , VBZ RB CD . 
So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on . 	RB DT NN IN DT NN IN CD VBZ NN IN JJ , CD IN CD VBZ CD NN RBR JJ , CC RB RB . 
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas . 	JJ NNS MD RB VB IN NNS WDT VBP JJ NNS . 
Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market . 	VB IN JJ NNS TO VB DT JJS NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NN . 
Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations . 	VB , RB , DT NN RB VBZ JJ NNS . 
`` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure . 	`` NNP VBZ JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN , '' VBZ NNP NNP NNP , DT NNP NNP NN NN WP VBD DT NN . 
`` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . '' 	`` EX VBZ NN WDT VBZ RB VBN IN NN NNS , CC DT NN VBZ RB VB PRP DT NN IN DT . '' 
In particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock . 	IN JJ , NN VBZ RB VB DT NN : CC JJ NN VBN IN DT JJ NN . 
That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks , but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio . 	DT `` NN '' NN VBZ RB JJ IN DT NN IN RB DT JJ NNS , CC PRP RB VBZ IN DT JJ CC JJ NN . 
Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer . 	NNP VBZ RB DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN NNS WDT VBP TO PRP$ JJ NN . 
In particular , the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired . 	IN JJ , DT NNS IN NN CC JJ NNS NNS VBP IN CC RB , CC DT NNS VBP TO VB JJ NNS IN PRP$ NNS VBP RB JJ . 
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide .

READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio ? 	NNP TO NNP DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN . 
First , a pop quiz . 	RB , DT NN NN . 
When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ? 	WRB PRP VBP IN DT NNS `` NN '' CC `` NN , '' WP VBZ DT JJ NN WDT VBZ TO VB . 
Pencils down . 	NNS RB .

But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others . 	CC RB VBZ DT NN IN NN NN : DT NN IN VBG PRP$ NN TO VB CD CC JJR NNS IN NN CC VBG JJ IN NNS . 
This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs . 	DT VBZ RB RB JJ NN TO DT PRP NNS WP VBP IN NNS DT NN , VBN IN NNS IN PRP$ NN VBG JJ IN JJ NNS . 
Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds . 	NN VBZ JJ NNS , CC NNS WDT VBP JJ IN CD NN IN JJ NN MD VB RB JJ IN JJ , RBR JJ NNS . 
U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity . 	NNP NNP NNS , IN NN , VBP NN WRB PRP VBZ TO VBG NN IN NN . 
But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments . 	CC PRP$ NN IN NNS MD VB VBN IN NN , WDT VBZ DT VBG NN IN NNS POS JJ NN NNS . 
Risk is also a function of time . 	NN VBZ RB DT NN IN NN . 
When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns . 	WRB JJ NNS VBP NN RB , PRP RB VBP IN DT NN IN JJ NNS . 
Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills , for example , because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider . 	NNS VBP RB JJR IN NNP NNS , IN NN , IN DT NN IN NN IN DT JJS NNS TO DT JJS VBZ RB JJR . 
That is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time . 	DT VBZ RB VBN IN DT JJ NN , CC NN , IN JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN IN NN . 
But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals . 	CC NNS WP VBP VBN IN JJ NNS MD VB VBG RB JJ NN TO DT JJ NN : RB VBG JJ NN TO VB JJ JJ CC NN NNS . 
For instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings . 	IN NN , DT NNS VBP VBN IN NNS IN DT CD NN NN : JJ NNP POS NN RB VBD DT NNS . 
But the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods . 	CC DT NN NN , IN DT JJ NNS , VBZ RB VBN JJ NNS IN VBN NNS .

As a result , financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios . 	IN DT NN , JJ NNS VBP PRP VBP JJ NNS WRB VBG DT NN IN NNS POS NNS . 
They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year . 	PRP VBP DT NN DT NN POS JJ NN VBZ JJ TO VB IN NN , IN IN DT JJ NN WDT VBZ WRB JJ DT NN MD VB NN IN NN . 
They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals . 	PRP VBP TO VB RP IN JJ NNS DT NN VBZ TO VB JJ NNS .

For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk . 	IN NN , DT VBN JJ NNS WDT VBP DT JJR NN POS NN VBD RB VBN IN JJ NN IN PRP$ JJ NN NN . 
But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk . 	CC PRP VBP DT NNS TO DT NN IN NN NN CC NN NN . 
The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue . 	DT JJR NN POS NNS VBP JJR NN IN DT JJ NN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN . 
Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return , 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % , as calculated by Seidman Financial Services , which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman . 	VB IN DT JJR NN POS NN VBZ DT JJR VBN JJ NN , CD NN IN CD NN , IN VBN IN NNP NNP NNPS , WDT VBZ DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP . 
That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings . 	DT RB VBZ DT JJ NNS .

-LRB- Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure : Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it . 	( RB POS WRB TO VB DT JJ NN NN : VB DT VBN NN CC VB CD JJ NN TO PRP .

What to do ? 	WP TO VB . 
First , generalize . 	RB , VB . 
Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .

If all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits . 	IN DT PRP VBP VBZ JJ NN , JJ NN : DT NN NN : VBZ PRP JJ NN IN PRP$ NN , IN NNS . 
It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age . 	PRP VBZ RB JJR IN JJ NN VBD IN DT JJ NN . 
But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires . 	CC `` NN '' VBZ RB IN : DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN NN RB CC MD VB VBN WRB PRP VBZ . 
It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it .

Sounds great -- or does it ? 	VBZ JJ : CC VBZ PRP . 
First , if I canceled , I 'd have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration . 	RB , IN PRP VBD , PRP MD VB DT JJR NN , DT RB JJ NN . 
Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit .

Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile .

And the Second Law , unique to insurance ? 	CC DT NNP NNP , JJ TO NN .

And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this .

One newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life -LRB- you pay for the whole policy at once -RRB- , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .

The reason is simple , Mr. Wyss says : `` Interest rates almost always decline during recession . '' 	DT NN VBZ JJ , NNP NNP VBZ : `` NN NNS RB RB VBP IN NN . '' 
As surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds . 	RB RB IN DT NN VBZ , VBG NN NNS VBP IN DT NN IN RB VBN NNS .

Corporate bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession , '' Mr. Wyss says . 	JJ NNS `` VBP RB RB DT JJ NN IN DT NN , '' NNP NNP VBZ .

This hurts the price of corporate bonds . 	DT VBZ DT NN IN JJ NNS . 
Also , he notes , `` most corporate bonds are callable . '' 	RB , PRP VBZ , `` RBS JJ NNS VBP JJ . ''

A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth . 	DT JJ JJ NN MD VB IN JJS DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN VBN IN NNPS IN DT NN NN . 
The theory relies on three assumptions : 	DT NN VBZ IN CD NNS : 
1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .

2 -RRB- Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues -LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large -RRB- and attending to local issues -LRB- constituency service and pork barrel -RRB- .

3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress . 	CD ) NNP JJ NNS , IN IN PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NN , VBP RBR JJ TO VB IN JJ NN IN VBP JJ NNS IN NNP . 
If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic . 	IN DT NNS VBP , NNS IN NNS IN NNP NN WP IN JJ NN VBZ VBN DT NN POS NN CC VBP DT NN , IN DT NN , TO VB JJ . 
If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies . 	IN PRP VBP DT NNP IN NN , RB RB MD PRP VB JJR IN NNS IN JJ NNS CC PRP$ VBN NN MD VB RB JJ TO VB JJ NNS IN `` VBG NN DT NN '' TO PRP$ JJ NNS . 
Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making . 	DT NN , IN DT , VBZ RB CD IN IN CD WRB PRP VBZ TO JJ NN VBG . 
In races for the White House , a voter 's incentive , at the margin , is to lean Republican . 	IN NNS IN DT NNP NNP , DT NN POS NN , IN DT NN , VBZ TO VB NNP . 
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district\/state , such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts\/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits . 	IN DT NNP NN MD VB JJ NNS TO DT NN POS JJ NN , JJ DT NN VBZ RB JJ TO VB RBR JJ IN VBG JJ NNS CC PRP$ NNS IN VBG NN DT JJ NNS . 
The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes . 	DT JJ NN POS VBG RB MD VB VBN IN JJR NNS . 
While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . 	IN DT NN VBZ RB JJ , PRP VBZ TO VB JJ NNS . 
First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . 	RB , WRB NN NN VBZ VBN CC VBN DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN : RB TO DT NN IN NNP NNP IN NN CC DT NN IN DT NNP NNP , NN VBD DT RB JJR NN IN NN CC DT NN POS NN NN VBG NNS IN NNS IN NNP VBD RB RBR JJ . 
Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . 	JJ , PRP VBZ WRB NNS VBP NNP IN NN CC RB VBP PRP$ JJ JJ NNS : DT JJ NN POS NNS VBP DT JJ NNS IN DT NN VBZ IN PRP CC RB DT JJ NN VBN IN DT JJ NN VBG RB IN PRP$ JJ NN . 
Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office . 	NNP , DT NN VBZ WRB NNS WP VBP RB JJ NN TO JJ NN VBG JJ TO JJ NN VBP JJR NN IN NN . 
For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat . 	IN NN , JJ NNS IN DT NNP , RB DT RBS JJ IN NNS , VBP VBN RB JJ TO VB . 
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 . 	DT CD NN TO DT JJ NN VBD DT NN IN CD IN DT CD NN NNPS VBN IN NN IN CD IN DT NNP NN CC VBG IN NN IN CD . 
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat . 	IN DT NNS VBN RB JJR NN IN PRP$ JJ NN : VBG DT NNP NN : IN JJ NN VBG , PRP VBD RBR JJ TO VB . 
Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office . 	NNP , DT NN VBZ WRB DT NNP NNP MD VB DT JJ NN VBG JJ NNS IN JJ NN . 
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent . 	JJ NNS MD VB VBN IN VBG JJR IN DT JJ NN IN IN DT NN IN NN IN DT NNS IN DT JJ NN . 
To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates .

Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South . 	NNP , DT NN MD VB IN JJS DT JJ NN IN WRB NN NN VBZ VBN RB VBN IN DT NNP . 
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .

Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House . 	RB , DT NN VBZ WRB NNPS RB VBP VBN JJR IN NNP NNS IN IN NNS IN DT NNP . 
Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts . 	IN JJ NN NNS JJR CC JJ NN VBG NNS JJR IN DT JJR NN IN NNP , DT VBZ RB DT NN PRP MD VB IN NNPS VBP RBR JJ TO VB IN JJ NN IN PRP$ JJ NNS . 
Is there any empirical support for this theory ? 	VBZ EX DT JJ NN IN DT NN . 
Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues . 	CD NNS IN NN VB DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS VBP RBR JJ TO VB IN JJ NN IN PRP$ NNP NNS . 
First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do . 	RB , NNS NNP NNP CC NNP NNP VB IN NNP NNS VBP RB RB CD NN JJR IN PRP$ VBN JJ NN NNS IN NNPS VBP . 
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns . 	TO DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN VBZ JJ NN , DT VBZ IN JJ NN VBZ JJ NNPS TO VB JJR NN TO VB NN NNS . 
Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking . 	JJ , IN DT JJ NN VBZ JJ , NNPS MD VB JJR NN NNS IN JJ NNS IN NNPS VBP TO DT NN IN JJ NNS VBP JJ NN VBG CC IN VBG IN JJ NNS VBZ RB IN DT NN DT NN MD RB VB TO JJ NN . 
This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House . 	DT VBZ RB WP DT NNS VBP , RB IN DT NN IN DT NNP . 
The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 . 	DT NNP NNP NN NN VBZ RB VBN DT NNP NNP NN NN IN CD . 
Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices . 	RB , IN VBN IN DT NN , NNPS VBP DT JJR NN IN PRP$ JJ NNS TO NN NNS : WRB JJ NN NNS VBP JJR CC JJ NN VBG NNS VBP RBR JJ TO NNP NNS . 
An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of that body changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff .

An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder -RRB- .

Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe . 	VB RBR RB , NNP NNS IN NN VBP VBN IN RBR RB IN NNS IN NNP NNS IN DT NNP WRB DT NN POS NN VBZ RBR JJ . 
Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level . 	RB , NN NN VBZ TO VB DT JJ JJ NN IN DT NN NN NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN . 
State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse . 	NN NN VBZ RBR RB VBP IN NNP NNS IN DT NN . 
A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .

2 . Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it . 	CD . RB WRB DT NNP VBD RB VB DT NN PRP VBD DT NN TO VB TO PRP .

The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse , if they had any effect at all . 	DT JJ NNS IN VBG DT NNP MD RB VB DT NN JJR , IN PRP VBD DT NN IN DT . 
Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors , one of the leading proposals today , is an example . 	VBG DT NNP IN DT NNP IN DT NNP IN NNP , CD IN DT VBG NNS NN , VBZ DT NN . 
The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money . 	DT NN VBZ DT NN POS JJS NN IN NN . 
He has a built-in , constant longing for lower interest rates . 	PRP VBZ DT NN , JJ NN IN JJR NN NNS .

These days , the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be , which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level .

How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board ? 	WRB MD DT JJ NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP VB DT JJ NN TO VB DT NN IN DT NN . 
Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level ? 	MD PRP RB VB PRP IN NN IN DT NNP TO VB JJ NN TO VBG DT NN NN .

The answer seems perfectly clear . 	DT NN VBZ RB JJ . 
-LRB- True , a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed . 	( JJ , DT NN IN NNP NNS VBZ VBN NN TO DT NN IN DT NNP IN DT NNP VBZ IN DT NNP . 
By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew , in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury , and probably also the Congress , should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot .

The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical . 	DT NNP POS NN VBZ RB IN PRP VBZ RB JJ , CC RB JJ . 
The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government . 	DT NNP VBZ JJ TO , CC MD RB VB VBG JJ TO , DT RBR RB JJ NN IN DT NN . 
The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president . 	DT NNP VBZ DT NN VBN TO PRP IN NNP CC DT NN .

Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic . 	NNS IN DT JJ NN VBP JJ TO VB IN PRP VBZ JJ .

The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months : the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude , and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere .

At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs . 	IN NN VBZ DT NN IN JJ NN NNS WDT VBP VBN IN RBS NNS .

Now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them . 	RB PRP MD VB WRB NNS WP VBP NNS MD VB NN WP VBZ VBG TO VB PRP JJR TO VB PRP . 
Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry . 	NN IN DT NN VBZ IN DT NN IN DT NN .

But for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day , breaking them by hand can get , well , out of hand . 	CC IN NNS IN NN NNS IN NNS DT NN , VBG PRP IN NN MD VB , RB , IN IN NN . 
The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple : put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets , spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets .

Chickens carry this bacteria , which can cause upset stomachs and , in rare cases , death among people . 	NNS VBP DT NNS , WDT MD VB VBN NNS CC , IN JJ NNS , NN IN NNS . 
Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs , and it can also be found on unclean shells . 	NNS RB VBP NN TO DT NNS , CC PRP MD RB VB VBN IN JJ NNS .

Mr. Maynard claims this is a manageable problem . 	NNP NNP VBZ DT VBZ DT JJ NN .
